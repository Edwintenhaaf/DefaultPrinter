DefaultPrinter

Rebuild of the RES Default Printer selection screen
to use with Ivanti User Workspacemanager (Environment Manager) or anything you like.

If a user has not set a default printer or to use as a 'monkey proof' choose your default printer screen instead of the native printer configuration page.
